Lev Manovich's quote, "Interactive media ask us to identify with someone else's mental structure," is quoted by Nakamura. This quote implies that when we use digital tools and platforms, we engage with their creators' ideas and presumptions. These mental models can be seen in the functionality, user interface, and overall design of these technologies, which in turn shapes our interactions and experiences with them.
As an illustration, consider the well-known social networking site Instagram. Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger had a vision for a platform for sharing visually appealing photographs and experiences when they created Instagram. The platform's core components and design decisions, which reflect their beliefs and goals, show their mental structure.
The designers' faith in the ability of images to provoke emotions and convey stories is highlighted by Instagram's emphasis on visual content. Large, square photos dominate the platform's user interface, which places less emphasis on language and encourages users to express themselves visually than with wordy descriptions or status updates.
 Instagram provides users with a choice of filters and editing tools to improve their images, highlighting the value of aesthetics and creativity in the minds of designers. With the help of these technologies, people can express themselves creatively and build a carefully crafted online identity.
 The designers of Instagram prioritized customization and the value of relevant, engaging material, which is shown in the algorithm's prioritization of posts from users and accounts that people interact with the most. Users are encouraged to engage with content that speaks to their interests and preferences, which has an impact on how they use the site.
The platform promotes social engagement through tools like comments, likes, and direct messaging, demonstrating the designers' appreciation of the value of community and connectivity in the digital age. Instagram's mental model prioritizes the development of online communities around shared interests and beliefs.
In conclusion, we engage with and adapt to the mental model of Instagram's designers when we use it. Their priorities, convictions, and values are ingrained in the platform's operation and design, influencing our perceptions of the digital world. As Lev Manovich noted in his work, this example exemplifies how interactive media asks us to identify with someone else's mental structure.
