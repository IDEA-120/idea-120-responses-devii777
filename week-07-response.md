James Bridle's "Something is Wrong on the Internet" has been interesting. The issues mentioned in the essay are realistic and something I have also been noticing recently. He talked about his concerns regarding technology and culture. It illustrates the significance of social media and the Internet in our lives, especially to one of the most vulnerable audiences, children. The Internet these days plays a massive role in shaping the mind of the youth, and what sort of content they consume is extremely important.
The Internet is vast, and there is so much content. It has gone out of hand and has become something that is not entirely in our control. While there is content that gets censored on the internet and social media platforms, there still are unhealthy videos that need to be edited or monitored adequately before or after being uploaded. The presence of content like this makes it easier to exploit kids and other vulnerable groups. 
Reading this, I agree with what Bridle mentioned about Kid's YouTube being marketed weirdly and the Suprise Eggs video era on YouTube; I remember watching these videos with my younger sibling when I was 10. These videos would be extremely long, and all they included was a person unwrapping Disney and kinder eggs and toys. And one thing I also noticed was that these videos "created' for kids had an immense amount of views. The purpose of these videos has never been to benefit the audience but rather to exploit them for opinions and profit millions. 
I agree with his concern about the infrastructural violence that is being done. And we can also understand how he sees the Internet as a medium to enhance our learning experience and expand our knowledge in a safe environment.
