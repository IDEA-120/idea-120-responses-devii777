For some reason, I am not able to attach my project so I will email it. 

I made my final project inspired by the first 3 projects. The flarf poem, the green screen project and the twine story line. 
Basically, I tried to merge them all and think of them as events happening with me in the course of two days. 
To illustrate that, I combines them into a diary entry and for more visual representation I made a pinterest board where I added a few pins from pinterest and created some of my own that would relate to the story.
