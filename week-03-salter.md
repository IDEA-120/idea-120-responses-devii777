The term “Gesamtkunstwerk” is a German word that means "a total work of art”. This term is used when multiple art genres are incorporated in one and unified as a whole. It was Richard Wagner who coined this term. This idea was developed throughout the 19th and the early 20th century by a various European art movements and became a fundamental element of modern art. It has been popular since then in Germany and Austria. This phrase is still in use to talk about multimedia artworks and other forms of art. 

Indian traditional dances like Bharatnatyam could, in my opinion, be considered another type of Gesamtkunstwerk. It has been practiced in temples with outstanding architecture and wall murals of Indian gods since its inception in Tamil Nadu. 
The dance tells stories through a variety of body movements, including mudras (symbolic hand gestures). The dancer's guru (teacher) is typically there, and there is music and a singer to accompany it. A Bharatnayam performance's live music is based on Carnatic classical music. The "Mridangam" is the prominent musical instrument for this, along with a pair of cymbals, the veena, the ghatam, and the flute. During the performance, the vocalists chant verses in the traditional Carnatic style. These verses are often written in the four languages of Sanskrit, Tamil, Kannada and Telugu.

Rhizome's Net Art Anthology, in my opinion, might also be considered a sort of Gesamtkunstwerk. As it incorporates several types of art, they are all presented online. 
An online show that spanned two years and told the story of net art from the 1980s to the present. The series will attempt the difficult task of identifying, preserving, and presenting exemplary works in a field marked by wide participation, diverse practices, promiscuous collaboration, and rapidly shifting formal and aesthetic standards through one hundred works—restaged and contextualized on a weekly basis at a dedicated microsite—sketching a potential net art canon.
