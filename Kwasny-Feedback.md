Devanshi,

Excellent work with your poetry project! This is an outstanding, creative approach to the assignment. Your use of conversational text message language gives this a distinct voice. It's something I think we can all relate to. The massive image with the compact text at the bottom helps make this a visually appealing composition. Viewing these hyperlinks, not as shortened versions, but with the entire 'url' reshapes how I think about the websites and videos I share with my friends. Great job!
