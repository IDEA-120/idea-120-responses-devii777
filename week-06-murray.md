Virtual reality and internet television have both come to pass, confirming Janet Murray's forecasts regarding these topics. The Mandalorian is one of the most notable examples of how virtual environments are used in producing movies and television shows today. 

The actors in "The Mandalorian" perform in "The Volume," a realistic virtual setting. The actors are surrounded by The Volume, a gigantic LED screen that serves as the background for the shot scenes. The actors may virtually inhabit the setting they are acting in, thanks to the 3D environment displayed on the screen.

The physical reality of the set is one layer of reality that both the actors and the audience in "The Mandalorian" experience. The actors are visually engaged in a virtual environment while physically standing in a studio with equipment and production personnel. The performers may interact with actual sets and props thanks to this layer of reality, which also gives them a sense of grounding. 

The virtual world itself is a further layer of reality. The performers can observe and interact with virtual creatures and items that aren't there. This additional layer of truth, produced by cutting-edge visual effects technology, gives the universe of "The Mandalorian" viewers a sense of immersion and plausibility.

The layer of reality that home viewers encounter comes last. They view the virtual environment's finished result as well as the actors' performances. In order to provide the spectator a smooth and coherent visual experience, a sophisticated combination of camera work, special effects, and post-production editing is used to create this layer of reality. 

In summary, Janet Murray's prophecies about people living in virtual worlds have undoubtedly come true in the world of film and television production. The movie "The Mandalorian" is a great illustration of how virtual environments may be used to produce a hyper-realistic and immersive experience for actors and spectators while simultaneously showcasing the various layers of reality that exist in contemporary film and television production.
